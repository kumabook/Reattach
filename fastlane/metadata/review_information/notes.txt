This app requires connection to the user's own server running "reattachd" daemon.

For review purposes, please use the built-in Demo Mode:

1. Launch the app
2. On the setup screen, tap "Try Demo Mode"
3. You can now test all features:
   - View sample tmux sessions (myproject, claude-demo)
   - Browse panes and view terminal output
   - Send commands (try: ls, pwd, git status)
   - Access Settings and Pro upgrade screen

Demo Mode shows simulated data without requiring a real server connection.
To exit Demo Mode, tap the "Demo Mode" badge at the top.
