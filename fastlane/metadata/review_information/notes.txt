This app connects to the user's own server running "reattachd" daemon.

For review, we have prepared a demo server. Please use the attached QR code:

1. Launch the app
2. Tap "Add Server"
3. Scan the attached QR code image
4. Enter Cloudflare Access credentials:
   - Client ID:
   - Client Secret:
5. Tap "Register Device"

You can now test:
- View tmux sessions running on the demo server
- Browse panes and view terminal output
- Send commands (try: ls, pwd, echo hello)
- Push notification settings
